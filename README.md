# LatexFormats_UVG

Here you may find some Latex Templetate that you may use in your academic coursework (or even personal).

So far you may find:

- Slide-presentation.zip  : Is a latex "power-point" to show your proofs.

- myTemplate_DepMate.zip : Is based on MAC template for the math department, only with some modifications to the organization of the files.

- MyTemplate_DepMate_WithCoolBoxes : Is based on MAC template for the math department, but with heavy changes.

Special thanks to MAC.
